lesson3 reflections

* git remote --> to view and create remotes
* git remote add origin url.git --> to create an alias to the remote repository, it is common to use origin as name
* git remote -v --> v for verbose shows the push and fetch urls
* git push origin master --> to send the changes in my master branch to the remote origin

* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with other team members.

* Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you have been working in some code and you donâ€™t want it to be overwritten by an automatic pull.
